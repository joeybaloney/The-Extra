"The Extra" is the first novelette I began working on.  Originally there was just a single chapter (Joey's two dreams), which I wrote
during my second trip to Detroit.  (A revised version of the dream was rejected from AGNI as of 24Oct2014.)
Some time later, I was inspired to write what is now Part I, incorporating the original chapter in it as a dream.
I sent a manuscript to B. for reading, he never got around to it.  Some time later, I was inspired to write what is now
the first chapter of Part II, "His Royal Judgesty".  I presented a draft of "His Royal Judgesty" to the High Wycombe library
writing group on 21Sept2014 (I think--if not, one of the adjacent fortnights).  The rest of Part II was written
incrementally.  "The Bus Stop" is partly based on material from the same writing session which inspired Part I in the first
place (and is also very vaguely based on a real life event in my life).  The last change (24Oct2014) before putting the project on Github
was to make the presiding judge's gavel be a "silver hammer".
